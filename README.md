# The Big Simple Short (A URL shortener)

A fully functional, minimal URL shortener implemented in Go. This project consists of three relatively simple handlers:

1. **HandleForm:** Displays a form to input URLs for shortening.
2. **Shorten:** Processes the submitted URL and generates a short key.
3. **Redirect:** Redirects to the original URL when a shortened URL is accessed.

## This is a speed run project, was implemented in a single sitting after studying a system design article about Bitly, and yes, the name is a pun on "**The Big Short**" movie.
